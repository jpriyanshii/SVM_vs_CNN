# SVM_vs_CNN
It demonstrates the difference between the models of Machine Learning model and Deep Learning using the MNIST dataset—a collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
In this project, I implemented:
✅ SVM (Support Vector Machine) - A traditional ML algorithm that uses flattened pixel data for classification.
✅ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) - A Deep Learning model that captures spatial hierarchies using convolutional layers.

After training both models, I compared their accuracy. The CNN performed significantly better, proving that deep learning is highly effective for image-based tasks.
